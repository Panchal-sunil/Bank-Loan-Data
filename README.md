📊 **Bank Loan Report** – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project presents a complete Bank Loan Performance Reporting System built using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python.
The goal is to monitor, analyze, and visualize key loan-related metrics to help banks make data-driven decisions, evaluate portfolio performance, identify trends, and differentiate between good and bad loans.

⭐ ** Project Overview**

The Bank Loan Report consists of three interactive dashboards:


1️⃣ **Summary Dashboard**
Provides an overall view of the bank’s loan portfolio, including:

-Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs<br>
-Loan Status Grid Table<br>

It helps stakeholders quickly assess the health and performance of the loan portfolio.
