📊 **Bank Loan Report** – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project presents a complete Bank Loan Performance Reporting System built using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python.
The goal is to monitor, analyze, and visualize key loan-related metrics to help banks make data-driven decisions, evaluate portfolio performance, identify trends, and differentiate between good and bad loans.
